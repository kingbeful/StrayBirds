When I compile the libuv for android, I encount a problem.

It runs well when I using libpomelo. 

And google tells me this:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/libuv/l0gqS58CErE

will check it later.

----------------------

In libpomelo I used an old version of libuv. And it can not used by my porject.

I've read the thread of the google group, it seems there is problem for gyp on OSX to compile the latest libuv. And at last using a linux to compile it.
